Live Scoreboard API - Specification
Overview
This document specifies the architecture and API design for a live scoreboard system. The module is designed to handle real-time score updates, process user actions that increase scores, and implement security measures to prevent unauthorized modifications.

1. Documentation for API Module (README.md)
System Requirements & Implementation
    1. Displaying the Top 10 Users' Scores
        The website maintains a scoreboard displaying the top 10 users based on their scores.
        The data is retrieved from a database and exposed via a REST API.
        ✅ API Endpoint:
        GET /api/leaderboard
        ✅ Response Example:
        [
        { "rank": 1, "username": "Alice", "score": 2500 },
        { "rank": 2, "username": "Bob", "score": 2400 }
        ]
    2. Live Scoreboard Updates
        The scoreboard updates in real time when a user’s score changes.
        Implemented via WebSockets to push updates to all connected clients.
        ✅ WebSocket Event:
        Event: score_update
        ✅ Payload Example:
        {
            "username": "Alice",
            "newScore": 2550
        }
        Clients subscribe to WebSocket events to reflect changes immediately.
    3. User Actions That Increase Score
        Users perform actions (e.g., playing a game, completing tasks) that increase their score.
        The specific action is not relevant to this module; the focus is on score updates.
        Once an action is completed, the frontend sends a request to the API.
    4. API Call to Update Scores
        The frontend dispatches a POST request when a user completes an action.
        ✅ API Endpoint:
        POST /api/score/update
        ✅ Request Body Example:
        {
            "userId": "12345",
            "scoreIncrement": 100
        }
        ✅ Server Processing Steps:
        1. Validate the user session/token to ensure authorization.
        2. Verify the score update (e.g., check for abnormal increases).
        3. Update the database with the new score.
        4. Broadcast the update to all clients via WebSocket.
    5. Security Measures Against Malicious Users
        To prevent unauthorized score increases, the following security measures are implemented:
            Authentication & Authorization:
                Uses JWT tokens to ensure only authenticated users can update scores.
            Rate Limiting:
                Restricts score update frequency per user to prevent spamming.
            Anti-Tampering Measures:
                Stores event logs for audits and detects anomalies in score changes.
                Uses a server-verified scoring system instead of relying on client inputs.

3. Additional Comments for Improvement
    Database Optimization:
        Use caching (e.g., Redis) to reduce frequent database queries.
    Cheating Prevention:
        Implement anomaly detection algorithms for sudden score spikes.
    Scalability Considerations:
        Use message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka) to handle large traffic efficiently.
    High Availability:
        Deploy load balancers and ensure distributed WebSocket connections for real-time updates.

4. Specification for Backend Engineering Team
    Technology Stack Suggestion:
        Backend: Node.js with Express.js
        Database: PostgreSQL (SQL-based) or MongoDB (NoSQL-based)
        WebSocket Framework: Socket.io
        Security: JWT authentication, Redis caching, and API rate limiting
    ✅ Tasks for the Backend Engineering Team:
        1. Implement REST API Endpoints (/api/leaderboard, /api/score/update).
        2. Develop WebSocket Communication for live updates.
        3. Set Up Authentication & Rate Limiting for security.
        4. Optimize the Database for efficient querying.
